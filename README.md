Mobile Programming project
Team Members: Jackson Justus & Lee Tisdale
Tasks done: The basis of the app has been layed out, this allows the user to enter their income and watch how the money should be spent. At the moment this app does not impliment the ability for the user to select different catagories for budgets and how they would like to distribute the income. This will be done in the near future
